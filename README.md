# ML-based Firewall Action Prediction System

## Overview

This project implements a **Machine Learning model** to automate and predict the actions of an internet firewall using behavioral data from network traffic. The main objective is to increase the efficiency of network security measures by predicting whether incoming connections should be allowed or denied, thus reducing manual intervention.

## Key Features

- **End-to-end Jupyter Notebook** to demonstrate dataset processing, model training, and prediction.
- Uses the open dataset: [Internet Firewall Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Internet+Firewall+Data)
- Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation steps.
- Demonstrates the use of popular Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`.

## Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Link**: [Internet Firewall Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Internet+Firewall+Data)
- **Description**: Contains traffic flow records labeled as permitted or denied based on firewall rules.

| README.md     | This fileâ€”Project overview, instructions |

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository or open directly in Google Colab**
2. Run all cells in `main.ipynb`
3. The notebook will:
   - Import and preprocess the data
   - Run exploratory analysis and feature engineering
   - Train and validate machine learning models
   - Output accuracy metrics and prediction confusion matrix

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

All dependencies can be installed using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Results

- Shows accuracy and performance metrics for different models
- Demonstrates which features contribute most to firewall action prediction
